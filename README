# Folder Contents

1. gen-hash.c - C file to generate the Hash Tables - hash_table1.bin and hash_table2.bin
Usage: 
$ cc -O3 -o gen-hash gen-hash.c
$ ./gen-hash <reference_genome_file>



2. hash-align.cu - CUDA file that matches read sequences of length 100 base pairs to the reference genome.
Usage:
$ nvcc -O3 -o hash-align hash-align.cu
$ ./hash-align <reference_genome_file> <read_sequence_file> 100 <machine_number> <start_sequence> <end_sequence>

Usage NOTES:
a. Name of the reference_genome_file : human_g1k_v37.bin
b. Name of the read_sequence_file : ERR050082.filt.bin
c. Start sequence should be a number between 0 and 283172 for the given read_sequence_file. Default value is 0.
d. End sequence should be a number between start sequence and 283173 for the given read_sequence_file. Default value is last index in the read sequence file.
e. The files hash_table1.bin and hash_table2.bin are already provided in the folder.
f. Machine number is a one of the strings provided in co2050.lst. The application needs to be executed for all the strings provided in the co2050.lst file. The multi-align.sh script does this.

3. setup.sh - Bash script file to copy the files in the machines specified in co2050.lst .
Usage:
$ bash setup.sh co2050.lst hash-align.cu <reference_genome_file> <read_sequence_file> hash_table1.bin hash_table2.bin

Usage Notes:
a. When the COMPILE_ONLY flag is 0 all the reference_genome_file, read_sequence_file,hash_tables and hash-align.cu are copied.
When COMPILE_ONLY flag is set to 1, only the hash-align.cu file is copied.
b.The CUDA source code is compiled for each run of the script. 

4. multi-align.sh - Bash script file to execute the binary on all the machines specified in co2050.lst 
Usage:
$ bash multi-align.sh co2050.lst hash-align.cu <reference_genome_file> <read_sequence_file> <start_sequence> <end_sequence>

Usage Notes:
a. co2050.lst has 23 machine ids specified in it. All the machines are required to perform matching for all the reads in the read sequence file. 
b. Start sequence should be a number between 0 and 283172 for the given read_sequence_file. Default value is 0.
c. End sequence should be a number between start sequence and 283173 for the given read_sequence_file. Default value is last index in the read sequence file.
